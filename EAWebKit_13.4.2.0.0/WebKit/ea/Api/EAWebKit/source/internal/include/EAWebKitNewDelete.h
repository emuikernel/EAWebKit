// The new/delete overrides below are there to deal with an MS VC++ issue.

//    #define new new(__FILE__, __LINE__)
// So you have code that uses just new(), it gets silently transformed into a different 
// function call. To make sure you aren't allocating memory from one heap (i.e. MS) 
// and free it with another (i.e. your heap), you need to make sure that you implement 
// that file/line version yourself so that those redefines result in your heap being used.
